Election-Audit Summary

This script was effective in determing the voter count and distribution for the local congressional election. However, with slight modification, the election commission could use this script for almost any other election. The voting data will need to be categorized in columns providing information like candidate chosen and location.

If there was an election where multiple candidates would win or advance, the script could add a print staement to include the top two or more candidates that received the most votes. Many elections also require voters to put down more information like their age, race, and sex. The script could be modified with an if-statement to provide data about who voted for the candiates based on other demographic information.

Those are just a couple ways the script could be modified to fit almost any election. I ask that the committee look at this proposal so we can discuss the script and how it can be used in the future.
